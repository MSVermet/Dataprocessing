Nic Marks, creator of the Happy Planet Index, explains why we need to measure success differently
<br/>
The Happy Planet Index measures what matters: sustainable wellbeing for all.
<br/>
It tells us how well nations are doing at achieving long, happy, sustainable lives.
<br/>
Wealthy Western countries, often seen as the standard of success, do not rank highly on the Happy Planet Index.
<br/>
Instead, several countries in Latin America and the Asia Pacific region lead the way by achieving high life expectancy and wellbeing with much smaller Ecological Footprints.
<br/>
The Happy Planet Index provides a compass to guide nations, and shows that it is possible to live good lives without costing the Earth.
